# Jr. Dev interviewing notes #
##############################

Redflags:
if they say "we need java and php, etc" they need back end person with
some front end skills

jr dev question:  is this a palyndrome

ask:  when they say "do you ahve questions for us?"
answer;  yes - what specific problems are  you looking for this role
  to solve?  How many people are on the team ( don't want to be alone).
  How many people are doing exactly what I'm doing?  I can do it on my
  own but want to do it with a team.

  ask about the company to customize your approach

  loook up the technical recruiter and chck out their github

when they ask something I don't know just say I don't know

coding challenges - ask how they want me to solve it
  do they want a quick run time or with less RAM memory.
  do you want me to take are of outliers?  ex:  negative integers,
    bad inputs, etc.

solve fibonaci sequence with recursion and without
  after, do tribonaci sequence

anagram is it similar forward and back

permutations
  find all possible permutations

collapsing
  if i have numbers 7,5,8 and add all the numbers, what is the total?

binary search trees (advanced)

check out code pen, ask owners if i can fix their codes
  back end community really likes this

good job title:
  tester, debugger, QA

Be able to use git in a group of 3 or more

go for front-end positions - it's an easier 'in'
  they want to knwo that i have a fully functioning app.
  login, logout, deployed
  less or sass
  code css on it's own without a framework

front end questions:
  if we were to ask you to use CSS, how would you develop a simple CSS
  snippet, how would you develop a cross browser ...?  I would normalize
  CSS or use media queries.

  can you have multiple elements on elements?

companys that work with microsoft, they've been doing meteor(like
mongoose)  and react(like angular)

on my phone see if i can dl developer interview questions

do video captures of my finished projects
tons of comments on my code to walk them thru
do a good readme to get them using

work with a recruiter
let them know i'm a junior full stack developer (1~2 years experience).  it'll be easier to get in the
door

KEY MOVE:  find bugs and look up documentation.  also optimize

look for jr full stack developer
